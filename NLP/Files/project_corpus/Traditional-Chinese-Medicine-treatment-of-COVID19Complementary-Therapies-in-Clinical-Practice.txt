A new kind of Pneumonia caused by new corona virus has been widespread in China since winter of 2019. No
effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than
flu. The Traditional Chinese Medicine is widely used in clinical practice in China, but many other countries of the
world to deal with diseases that remain clinically challenging.

This new viral pneumonia was named COVID-19, and declared as
Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. When the COVID-19 broke
out, tens of thousands of Chinese people were infected, especially in
Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province [1], where the infection rate
was extremely high. At present, the cumulative number of diagnoses
worldwide is 645,957. Chinese government made relevant decisions
quickly to control the spread of the epidemic disease. For example, on
January 20, 2020, Chinese government classified COVID-19 as a Class B
infectious disease and treated it as Class A [2].
Supportive therapies are mainly used in clinical practice, such as
oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy and corticosteroid therapy, because
there is no specific effective treatment [3]. According to past experi­
ences in the treatment of infectious diseases in China, Traditional Chi­
nese Medicine, including herbal formulas, can be used to prevent and
treat such infectious disease [4,5]. Therefore, Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China
promptly. Here we introduce the herbal formulas that are commonly
used in Chinese hospitals.
